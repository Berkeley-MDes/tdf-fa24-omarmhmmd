# Week 5-6
Last week I presented some design work in Brooklyn, so I missed class! I have some experience with microcontrollers, however. This is a project I worked on during my last time at UC Berkeley: Qiblah https://omarmhmmd.notion.site/Qiblah-3f57157cfb984576a9d40ff4b4739832.

It uses a bunch of components, leds, a compass, a touch capacitor, to make visible the direction of the qiblah through a physical interface. It took me about three weeks to complete.

Right now, I'm not having much fun with the particle/photon. I don't think it's as intuitive as a raspberry pi and arduino, and definitely not beginner friendly. It's also way more "engineering" than a "design" tool. I'm confused on its usage in class. I was able to get the touch capacitor to work pretty easily though.

I have some ideas that I've been wanting to work on with microcontrollers for a while. One of them is a concept called MakkahTV, or MTV. https://www.are.na/omar-mhmmd/makkahtv.

Makkah has been live streamed on TV since I can remember watching a live satellite transmission at my grandparents as a child. This livestream has evolved to the internet as a YouTube live stream with a live message board. The holy city of the Prophet [SAW] Madinah is also live streamed. Cultural objects pertaining to Islamic prayer times have often taken on the form of the Ka'aba, the main center of focus in these live streams.

I imagine a meta-object, a ka'aba "televsion" whos walls are the screens of the live stream, depicting itself.

In this sketch, a 3D printed cube houses small screens that are connected to a youtube live stream, through a rasberry pi that is houses in an acrylic base. This use of material slightly emulates the actual build and materiality of the ka'aba, without being a 1:1 reference. I am conducting research on how the Photon can handle video, or if a need for a rpi will become necessary. I'm hoping to use my time in studio foundations to create the 3D and laser cut elements of the model. We shall see.

# Week 4
Grasshopper is EXTREMELY popwerful. Before project 1, I had never worked with grasshopper, relying primarily on sketching and static rhino drawings to explore form and object properties. Exploring even the basics of grasshopper has opened my eyes to physical design and the overall design process. A simple garbage on the side of the road appears differently to me now; what methods and computation could I design this garbage can with in grasshopper that would produce novel ideas through the design process. 

My first attempt at a parametericized design in grasshopper. I was mind blown at the possibilities this afforded.

After many iterations and evaluations, my initial assumptions and ideas for to the project shifted. Grasshopper enabled me to break my idea down, realize it was "incorrect", and allow me to proceed to a successful outcome.

The project for this week was really great when it came to the software and the process, however the execution and timing was a little rough. I really believe we should have been given more time to explore, and perhaps had a critique of round 1/version 1 printouts. I'm hoping that future assignments will be more organized and give students ample time for the design process and the production process.

# Week 3
I think I was feeling pretty overwhelmed after weeks 1-2. The Wednesday start, the Monday off; everything felt rushed and intense! Things have relaxed and I'm finding a rhythm between all my classes. I've had some time to finally think about this course and what I want to get out of it. My initial sketches and ideas for project one are below. I think this is the "final" stage of difficulty...but let's see how far I can get! It's a challenge using grasshopper, NOT GUNNA LIE. 

## Rehal رحل
Visual research -> https://www.are.na/omar-mhmmd/rehal

![September_12_2024_15h50m19s](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cf77dc6-28ec-47b9-9b37-f013033d5238)


I've been thinking a lot about rehals, or "book stands", since my aunt gifted me one from Turkey when I performed a khatm-e-quran (full reading of the quran) at her home. It's a big one, with many intricate designs carved out of it. This opened my eyes to the rehal as an islamic design object, a functional device that evokes beauty, ultimately to the Divine. The rehal is a bookstand, but it's main use is to never allow a Qur'an to touch the ground. In masjids, the tradition of sitting on the ground, with no furniture except chairs for the elderly and injured, has remained a constant.

In order to read the Qur'an a stand that can be folded, put away, and re-emerge simply was required. I need to do more research on the history of this object, however the word "rehal" in its verb form in Arabic means "to saddle, to mount"; referencing camel saddles, the bookstand rehal appears a saddle for books. The rehal today is traiditonally carved from one piece of wood, embedded with chiseled joints, and ran through a saw to "open" the joints and fold. This video has 1.9m views from a year ago; perhaps I'm not the only one who's thinking about them. -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoiyqCeHlk

In people's home, at the masjid, in prayer spaces, one comes across a multide of rehals in different sizes, shapes, and craftsmanship. I've wondered what a 3D printed rehal, or CNC'd rehal, or just a 3D rendering would look like, and what the software and technologies might add or takeaway from it. I've never used grasshopper, but I think the software enables a great challenge in investigating quickly and iteratively different shapes, sizes, angle openings, and orientations of the object. I'm especially interested in embedding islamic patterns, even if simple, using grasshopper; I think that type of design is one of its strengths!

This is a gif showingmy progress in designing one in GH. I'm only able to explore different widths really, but I'm hoping for my next step to be able to explore angle openings.

<br>
The angle openings and position of the center joint on the z-axis can radically shift the form of the shape.

<br>
Notice the elongated legs which creates a wider angle between the base legs.

<br>
My grasshopper code so far contains duplicates, which I don't think is the best way of doing things...I'm hoping to get the some guidance today in class on this!

# Week 2

### On the syllabus
* I feel like the syllabus is very overwhelming
* Too many links without enough context, or maybe it's just early in the semester but this is how I'm feeling
* Tutorials shared with students must be placed within a contextual framework
* Provide a historical or contexual framework to build an assignment to learn from
* Give a *reason*, not just the sake of the tutorials
