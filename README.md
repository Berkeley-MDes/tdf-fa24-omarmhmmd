# Week 3
I think I was feeling pretty overwhelmed after weeks 1-2. The Wednesday start, the Monday off; everything felt rushed and intense! Things have relaxed and I'm finding a rhythm between all my classes. I've had some time to finally think about this course and what I want to get out of it. My initial sketches and ideas for project one are below. I think this is the "final" stage of difficulty...but let's see how far I can get! It's a challenge using grasshopper, NOT GUNNA LIE.

I've been thinking a lot about rehals, or "book stands", since my aunt gifted me one from Turkey when I performed a khatm-e-quran (full reading of the quran) at her home. It's a big one, with many intricate designs carved out of it. This opened my eyes to the rehal as an islamic design object, a functional device that evokes beauty, ultimately to the Divine. The rehal is a bookstand, but it's main use is to never allow a Qur'an to touch the ground. In masjids, the tradition of sitting on the ground, with no furniture except chairs for the elderly and injured, has remained a constant.

In order to read the Qur'an a stand that can be folded, put away, and re-emerge simply was required. I need to do more research on the history of this object, however the word "rehal" in its verb form in Arabic means "to saddle, to mount"; referencing camel saddles, the bookstand rehal appears a saddle for books. The rehal today is traiditonally carved from one piece of wood, embedded with chiseled joints, and ran through a saw to "open" the joints and fold. This video has 1.9m views from a year ago; perhaps I'm not the only one who's thinking about them. -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoiyqCeHlk

In people's home, at the masjid, in prayer spaces, one comes across a multide of rehals in different sizes, shapes, and craftsmanship. I've wondered what a 3D printed rehal, or CNC'd rehal, or just a 3D rendering would look like, and what the software and technologies might add or takeaway from it. I've never used grasshopper, but I think the software enables a great challenge in investigating quickly and iteratively different shapes, sizes, angle openings, and orientations of the object. I'm especially interested in embedding islamic patterns, even if simple, using grasshopper; I think that type of design is one of its strengths!

This is a gif showingmy progress in designing one in GH. I'm only able to explore different widths really, but I'm hoping for my next step to be able to explore angle openings.

<br>
The angle openings and position of the center joint on the z-axis can radically shift the form of the shape.

<br>
Notice the elongated legs which creates a wider angle between the base legs.

<br>
My grasshopper code so far contains duplicates, which I don't think is the best way of doing things...I'm hoping to get the some guidance today in class on this!

# Week 2

### On the syllabus
* I feel like the syllabus is very overwhelming
* Too many links without enough context, or maybe it's just early in the semester but this is how I'm feeling
* Tutorials shared with students must be placed within a contextual framework
* Provide a historical or contexual framework to build an assignment to learn from
* Give a *reason*, not just the sake of the tutorials
