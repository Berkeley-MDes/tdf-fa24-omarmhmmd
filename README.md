## Week 1

### On the syllabus
* I feel like the syllabus is very overwhelming
* Too many links without enough context, or maybe it's just early in the semester but this is how I'm feeling
* Tutorials shared with students must be placed within a contextual framework
* Provide a historical or contexual framework to build an assignment to learn from
* Give a *reason*, not just the sake of the tutorials
