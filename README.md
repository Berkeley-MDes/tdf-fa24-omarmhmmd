# Week 1

### On the syllabus
* I feel like the syllabus is very overwhelming
* Too many links without enough context
* Tutorials shared with students must be placed within a contextual framework
* You can't just throw out giant lists of tutorials and expect students to go through them one-by-one and learn!
* Provide a historical or contexual frameowkr to build an assignment to learn from
* give a *reason*
